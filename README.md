## Overview

Repository Crawler is an experimental tool that combines multi-agent LLM analysis with local codebase exploration. It provides a streamlined interface for code analysis, documentation, and understanding through:

- üå≤ Interactive file tree visualization
- ü§ñ Multi-agent LLM analysis (up to 25 specialized roles)
- üíæ Persistent memory using ChromaDB
- üìä Real-time token usage and cost tracking
- üîÑ Parallel agent analysis capabilities
- üîë Flexible API key management

## Current Status

- **Alpha Stage**: Core functionality is implemented but undergoing frequent changes
- **Performance**: Large repositories may experience slowdowns
- **Stability**: Expect occasional errors and edge cases
- **Security**: Basic validation implemented, but needs further hardening

## Supported LLM Providers

- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- DeepSeek
- Google (Gemini 1.5 Pro) - Coordinator for multi-agent synthesis

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo_crawler.git
cd repo_crawler

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

2. Configure your environment:
   - Add API keys in the LLM Settings tab
   - Set up repository path in File Settings
   - Configure ignore patterns if needed

## Known Limitations

- Large repositories (>1GB or >10k files) may experience performance issues
- Memory usage can be significant with large codebases
- Some features are experimental and may not work as expected
- UI responsiveness varies with repository size
