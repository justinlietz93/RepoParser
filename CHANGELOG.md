- 🔄 Improved directory nesting representation
- 🔄 Enhanced CDATA wrapping for file contents
- 🔄 Changed default model to GPT-4 throughout application
- 🔄 Updated model selection order in UI
- 🔄 Improved logging configuration and consolidation
- 🔄 Standardized path handling across components

### Removed
- 🗑️ Redundant "Copy Prompt" button (using built-in code block copy functionality)
- 🗑️ Duplicate logging configurations
- 🗑️ Platform-specific path separators

### Fixed
- 🔧 Token analysis display improvements
- 🔧 Error message presentation enhancements

### Known Issues
1. UI Components:
   - Component nesting restrictions
   - Label accessibility requirements
   - State persistence challenges
   - Layout consistency issues

2. Backend:
   - Incomplete file traversal implementation
   - Missing 'files' attribute handling
   - Error propagation improvements needed
   - Linux file permission handling needs verification

3. XML Generation:
   - Nested directory handling issues
   - CDATA section formatting problems
   - Path representation inconsistencies

4. Cross-Platform:
   - File permission handling in Linux
   - Case sensitivity in file paths
   - Path separator consistency in XML

### Next Steps
1. Fix repository traversal system
2. Improve XML generation formatting
3. Enhance error handling in file tree component
4. Address label accessibility warnings
5. Implement proper state management
6. Add comprehensive testing
7. Verify Linux compatibility
